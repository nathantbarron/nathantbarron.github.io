I earned my M.A. and B.S. in political science from the University of Southern Mississippi.\nMy dissertation offers a new theoretical perspective on agenda setting and provides new methodological tools for incorporating theory-driven feedback into measures of the U.S. Congressional agenda. The first proposed paper explores how agenda setting affects ideological scaling under various agenda setting regimes and institutional characteristics. The second paper introduces a sequential ideal point estimation framework that addresses endogeneity concerns when determining the spatial location of proposed policy alternatives. The third paper seeks to measure and describe agenda setting regimes over time with respect to restriction severities and when control becomes relaxed. These projects draw on insights and strategies from legislative politics, policy studies, and computational methodology.\nMy broader research agenda centers on how institutions shape behavior, particularly in Congress and state legislatures. I also actively research religion and politics and new developments in methodology. My work has appeared in Legislative Studies Quarterly, American Politics Research, and the Election Law Journal."

    "text": "Nonpartisan Pork: Partisan Issues and the Effectiveness of Credit Claiming\n\nNathan Barron and Peter McLaughlin\nAbstract: Traditional accounts of Congressional politics suggest that distributive (or “pork barrel”) spending can help members of Congress (MCs) increase electoral support by cultivating a personal vote. However, the potential to realize these nonpartisan benefits is uncertain in contexts of high partisan polarization. Drawing on recent literature that shows people are sensitive to implicit party cues, we test a theory of partisan issue ownership in the context of Congressional credit-claiming. Using a survey experiment where respondents are presented with fabricated press releases from their actual member of Congress, we consider whether implicit party associations shape the electoral benefits to be gained from credit-claiming. We find that constituents are more likely to increase their approval for their representative when claiming credit for increased spending on a “nonpartisan” issue. While partisanship colors much of Congressional politics, our findings suggest that distributive politics offer MCs an opportunity to simultaneously strengthen support and ease opposition.\nPaper: Link"
