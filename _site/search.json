    "text": "I am a doctoral candidate in political science and graduate fellow with the Carl Albert Congressional Research and Studies Center at the University of Oklahoma. I earned my M.A. and B.S. in political science from the University of Southern Mississippi.\nMy dissertation introduces a theoretical model of policy diffusion that elucidates how policies adapt throughout the policy process. My primary argument is that two types of adaptation uniquely and independently allow policy sharing across subnational governments: entrepreneurial adaptation and institutional adaptation. I demonstrate how the theoretical model implies improved measurement strategies and observational expectations in policy diffusion studies. Finally, I show how this approach provides a helpful framework for understanding why some diffusion attempts succeed and others fail. This project draws on insights and strategies from policy studies, legislative politics, and computational methodology.\nMy broader research agenda centers on how institutions shape behavior, particularly in Congress and state legislatures. I also actively research religion and politics and new developments in methodology. My work has appeared in Legislative Studies Quarterly."

    "text": "Nonpartisan Pork: Partisan Issues and the Effectiveness of Credit Claiming\n\nNathan Barron and Peter McLaughlin\nAbstract: Traditional accounts of Congressional politics suggest that distributive (or “pork barrel”) spending can help members of Congress (MCs) increase electoral support by cultivating a personal vote. However, the potential to realize these nonpartisan benefits is uncertain in contexts of high partisan polarization. Drawing on recent literature that shows people are sensitive to implicit party cues, we test a theory of partisan issue ownership in the context of Congressional credit-claiming. Using a survey experiment where respondents are presented with fabricated press releases from their actual member of Congress, we consider whether implicit party associations shape the electoral benefits to be gained from credit-claiming. We find that constituents are more likely to increase their approval for their representative when claiming credit for increased spending on a “nonpartisan” issue. While partisanship colors much of Congressional politics, our findings suggest that distributive politics offer MCs an opportunity to simultaneously strengthen support and ease opposition.\nPaper: Link"
